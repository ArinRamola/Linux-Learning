Pipelines
  for a command such as
  cut < date.txt --delimeter " " --field 1
  can be written through pipeline as
  date | cut --delimeter " " --field 1
  and then again we can do to save the output
   date | cut --delimeter " " --field 1> file.txt
  
Now if you want to send the output in pipeline but in between want to take something like a snapshot what we do is
  date| tee sanp.txt | cut  --delimeter " " --field=1>file.txt
  Now if you want to continue the pipeline without ending you can use is-
  date| tee snap.txt|cut -d " " --field=1 | tee file.txt 

  we use xargs to convert standard input to command line argument
  so if you write - 
  date | echo -no output
  but if you give like this - 
  date | xargs echo - date will be printed by echo
  and if you want to print something before just -
  date | xargs echo "hello" - print hello before printing date
  Now we can us it like if we want to remove file1 and file2 which are saved in filetoremove file in form of their names
  we use - cat filetoremove | xargs rm -- and file names inside would be deleted

  Aliases -
  aliases are used to make a custom command that can be used to run a command or a pipeline
  so aliases are saved in a file with extension .bash_aliases file in your home folder and then reboot it. It would be a hidden file.

an example - i created a file called myalias.bash_aliases and in it i will make a alias 
  -alias dateal=" date | xargs echo "hello" " 
  so as we enter calmagic in cmd we will get the output of this small pipeline
  now if i enter
  -alias calma=" xargs cal -A 1 -B 1 > /home/Arin/thing.txt"
  you will see that when you enter - 12 2024 | calma
  -- you will see no output but actually a file name thing.txt would have the output of this small pipeline.
