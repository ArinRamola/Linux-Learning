Command = CommandName -options input
options modify a commands behaviour
Ex - if cal gives calender
and if cal 12 2025 gives the month of december 2025
then cal -A 1 12 2025 - this will give you december and a month after the December
same if you give cal -B 1 12 2025 - this will give you december and a month before December.
