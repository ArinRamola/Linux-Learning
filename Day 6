Locate Command-
locate anypattern like name or anyhting
ex locate *.conf
---give path of all the files ending with .conf
it also locate case sensitively so use -i to locate case insensitively
use --limit no. -- to use no. of results you want to limit
it find all the data using the database. 
in fact it can find database itself use = locate -S
since you cant know for sure if a file exist in database use-
locate --existing .*conf ----- gives files with .conf that exist in the database
since locate command do use database to work.
Now since ther eare times that database do not update the file that's in your system we use -
sudo updatedb- since its a system admin privilege command

Find-
find is same as Locate with the diffrence it finds the file in real time.
It scans the file system in real life.
Its slower than locate but more reliable than the locate.
- find filename
- find file_path
-find ---- shows every single file and folder in the file system within which directory you are currently in.
- depth is how deep a find will go. so like how many folder it will go inside.
so if you write
- find . -maxdepth 1 --- so it will find maximum one depth in the current directory( . ).
if want only file from current directory
- find . -type f
if only want folders from current directory
- find . -type d
combine the commands
- find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -- show file only upto one depth

to find a file using name
- find . -name "file1.txt"
-find . - name "*.txt"
-find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.txt"
use -iname for case insensitive.

to find file based on size
-find / -type f -size +100k --- find file larger than 100kb from root
-find / -type f -size -100k --- find file smaller than 100kb from root( /)
use sudo if you get access denied
we can also count the no. of line from the result using piping-
- sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size -5M | wc -l
if you want to use something like AND no need to do anything just do but if you want to use OR then-
- sudo find / -type f -size +100k -o -size -5M | wc -l
-sudo find / -type f -size +100M -size -5M

exec 
-sudo find / -type f -size +100M -o -size -5M -exec cp {} ~/Desktop/copy_here \;
