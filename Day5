Handling diffrent types of file in linux
-  linux doesn't care about the type of extension
so if you write - file tux.png or file tux.jpg ---- result would be same
so what happen is every file has a header which tells its type or extension
so even if you change the extension of that file - its would still show same result
so in linux you have the freedom to name your files as per your wish like file.arin
but dont try to confuse the third part software. like make .pdf to .txt. it will still show it as .pdf but when open it may throw error.


if you want to see anything that starts with any letter like - D-
so just enter ls D* -- it will show all folders starting with D
make sure they are correct case as they are case -sensitive
so if you do ls *.txt - it shows anything that is with extension .txt

to make a file use mkdir
if you use mkdir happy birthday - two file happy and birthday would be created
so use " " to if you want to make a file Happy Birthday
to make mutliple files that record thing every month for two year-
mkdir {jan,feb,march,april,may,june,july,august,september,october,november,december}_{2026,2027}
same for no. in a series you can do - mkdir {1..10}- make file from 1 to 10
same can be done to create multiple file using touch
or you can also do is ----- touch {jan,feb}_{2026..2027}/file{1..10}
now inside folders of jan and feb from both years you will get file1 to file10T
To create a entire path like Folder B inside Folder A and Folder C inside Folder B use -p
--- mkdir -p A/B/C
--- touch A/B/C/file1.txt
