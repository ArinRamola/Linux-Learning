Sorting -

-sort filename - it by default sorts line from a to z
-sort filename | tac - a way to reverse sort
-sort -r filename -- in built way to reverse
-sort number.txt --- in a file with numbers instead of sorting by value it sort based on the first digit of that number
-sort -n number.txt ---- to sort numerically
-sort -u number.txt ---- to get only the unique number
-ls -l /etc | head -n 15 | sort -k 5n - so its show all files of etc and only show 15 lines and sort it numerically
as per the 5th column.
-ls -lh /etc | head -n 15 | sort -k 5nr - same but now size in human readable format and but now it will not show proper sorting
-ls -lh /etc | head -n 15 | sort -k 5hr - now it will sort in human readable format.
-ls -lh /etc | head -n 15 | sort -k 6M - now to sort date as per months
-ls -l /etc | head -n 15 | sort -k 2n

Archiving and Compression-

tar - to compress
c - to archive
v- verbose - let one know what system is doing
f- to let tar accept files
- tar -cvf newcompressed.tar file[1-3].txt
a tar file can be more bigger in space compared to all the total file size inside it
-tar -tf filename.tar - to see the inside the tar file 't' her emeans test label
- tar -cvf filename.tar - to extract
for compression we generally use bzip or gzip - gzip for faster but less compression and bzip for slower but more compression
- bzip2 filename.tar - this will decrease the size of the file
it give filename.tar.bz2 so to unzip
- bunzip filename.tar.bz2 
if you just want zip file commomnly used in windows then use-
-zip filename.zip path
-unzip filename.zip
so to create a tar and a zip file in one go
- tar -czvf filename path-to-the-file-to-be-compressed

- Scripting intro -
file name should be ending with .sh
- vim script.sh
the file should start with -
- #!/bin/bash   --- for bash
- #!/bin/python  ----- for python
now inside this file write any commands or make any pipeline that you want to be done once executed
also while writing if you dont want the error of the command or pipeline just direct it to bit bucket(2>dev/null).

Now say you created a file named backup where once executed all the data of your pc goes to a single zip folder. To make it
run and execute as a command we will put it in .bashrc in bottom.
- PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
since  we created a directory bin inside Home directory where bin contain all the scripts.

Cron - scheduling
Crontab - contains command and scripts that will run automatically
crontab -e ---- to edit a crontab
crontab has # lines that are kind of comments that dont interfere
each crontab is broken into rows and one row is for each command or script that you want to schedule.
each row will have six columns 
so the the first five columns are scheduling information and final sixth for command or script to be run at scheduled time.
first column - minute --- at which minute script should execute
second coulumn - hour ---- at which hour scipt or command should execute
third column - day of month ------ at which day of month it should execute
fourth column - month --- at which month it should execute
fifth column -day of week ----- at which day of the week it will execute
sixth column - command or script to execute
-  25 10 3 1 * echo "Hello World" >> ~/Desktop/Hello_world.txt ------ so what it will do is that every 3rd of January At 
10:25 am this script will execute.
TO  make it run every some minutes or some hours or even some days use '*/'.
- */3 */1 * * * echo "hello worls" --- every 1hour and every 3 minutes hello worls would be executed.
- 50 18 * 12,11,10 MON echo "heheeh" ---- every december november and october during mondays at 6:50 pm this will execute.
- 50 18 * * MON bash script.sh ----- every monday 6:50pm this script would executed.
