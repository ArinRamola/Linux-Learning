To read a manual page there are some ways or rules i would say-
to understand this i would rather use an example-
if you man which--
it would show you rather the manual to use the ehich command-
in synopsis its the method to apply and Description tells about it.
now synopsis says - which [a] filename ...
now which is command in this 
a is option which optional which is told by the square bracket its in inside.
filename is the command name
and ... - ellipses tells that it can take more than one command
like you can give which date cal
<>- anything in the angle bracket must to have. mean its not optional
if man sometimes not work use help

Data Stream is basically flow of data simply from one place to another
there are four data streams-
Standard Input- pipe for input
Standard Output - pipe for normal output
Standard Error- pip for error
Extra Data Stream - An extra pipe you can create and use for anything.
now there are ways you can redirect in these pipelines
-> 1> - to redirect the output
-> 2> - to redirect the error
-> 3> - to redirect FD3 mainly for pipeline

For Redirection we use -
> -redirects with truncate
>> - redirects with appending
