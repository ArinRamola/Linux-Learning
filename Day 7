Continuing the find command-

sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size -5M -exec cp {} -/Desktop/copy_here \; -- copy results to the copy_here folder
sudo find / -type f -size +100k -size -5M -ok cp {} -/Desktop/copy_here \; --  if we use ok so now everytime before copying something it will ask if its ok to copy that file
mkdir haystack/folder{1..500} -exec
touch haystack/folder{1..500}/file{1..100}
touch haystack/folder$(shuf -i 1-500 -n 1)/needle.txt  - basicaly makes a file needle.txt and put it in one the folders among the 500 folders randomly
find haystack/ -type f -name "needle.txt" -exec {} ~/Desktop \;

Viewing a file
- cat filename
-cat file1 file2 file3
-tac filename -- result would be last line first and first line last
-cat file[1-5]
- rev filename - reverse words in each line
- cat filename | head -n 5 --- by default the head command gives first 10 lines so we modified it to only give first 5 lines
or simply 
- head -n 5 filename
- head -n 5 filename | wc -l
-tail -n 5 filename - tail for last 10 lines
